//booleans & comparison operators.

let num1 = 7;
let num2 = 8;

console.log(num1 >= num2); //this will print false since num1 is not greater than num 2

//boolean will either be true or false.

//comparison operators - this will compare two values and gives the output.

let num3 = "5";
let num4 = 5;

// == vs ===
console.log(num3 == num4); //this will print true, because both the values are same.
console.log(num3 === num4); //this will print false, since === will check the data type of the value.

//let's discuss about != vs !==
console.log(num3 != num3); //this will print false, since the both the values are same.
console.log(num3 !== num4); //this will print true, since the data types are different.
