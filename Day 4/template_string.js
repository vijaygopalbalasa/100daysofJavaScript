//template string is used to make life easy by assinging variable inside the string without concatenating. for example,

let age = 21;
let name = 'vijaygopal';

let aboutMe = `my name is ${name} and my age is ${age}`; //here we have used blacktick instead of quotes so that we can bring variable value to string itself.
console.log(aboutMe);
